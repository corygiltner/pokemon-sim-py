    "\n",
    "Many times developers want to create software that can be reused in the program or shared across other programs. This concept is called [Extensibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility), simply how easy is it to extend the program. Python - as well as other [object oriented languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_object-oriented_programming_languages) - contain classes. Classes are composed of attributes and methods that encapuslate shared functionality. To go indepth on classes we will four three main topics\n",

    "## Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "When software is designed, we often model real-world details in code, called [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)). To model our software after real-world details we want to model classes after things name like nouns ```Kart``` or ```Player``` and noun phrases like ```Driver```. Then to models actions we use functions and methods with verb names as in ```drive()``` or ```enter_in_race(driver)```. This makes sure we know and understand what our code is intended for and how it is used. Let's model out Mario Kart."
